This project designs a 4-bit ripple carry adder using four full adders
connected as shown in Ripple-Carry Adder.png diagram. The two 4-bit
inputs are a[3:0] and b[3:0]. The outputs are 4-bit s[3:0] and carry c3.

In order to run the simulation successfully, you need to change the default
simulation time of 1000 ns into 1s as shown in "SimulationSettingsAdjust.png" file.
