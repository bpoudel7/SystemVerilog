This counter counts on every positive edge of the clock.
The reset initializes the counter to the starting count
value. For up counter, the starting value is 0 while, for
the down counter, the starting value is 15. The counter
functions as up counter if "upDown" input is '1' and 
behaves as down counter for "upDown" as '0'.
